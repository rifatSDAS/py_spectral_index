# py_spectral_index
This a repository for numbers of spectral index for remote sensing studies. All of the available spectral indexes are coded in python.
All of these spectral indexes are based on Sentinel 2A Level 2A (BOA after atmospheric correction by Sen2Cor atmospheric correction tool) for as an example.
However, the code can run for any input images with geotiff format.
